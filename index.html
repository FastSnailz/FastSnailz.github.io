<p>MP3 is a compressed digital music format with the purpose of producing high-quality sound file.(WebWise Team, 2012). Although there are over thirty digital music formats available, MP3 is mostly used (Denegri-Knott, 2015, p.397-401). This is the main reason MP3 has been successful. Due to its popularity and ability to maintain high quality sound, while keeping file sizes small enough to store additional tracks. </p>
<p>MP3 achieves its powerful compression by removing a chunk of the sounds in a song or instrumental which our ears are unable to process. It then uses complicated algorithms to reduce file sizes further (Webwise Team, 2012). With this smaller size, MP3’s are able to be emailed and uploaded/downloaded in a quick and efficient manner. <p>
<p>During the MP3’s emergence it had no correlation with music or its related industries. It’s initial release was intended for professional broadcasters(Denegri-Knott, 2015, p.397-401). <p>
	<p>Normally you could only fit about 16 tracks into an audio CD using an older format (.WAV). But with MP3 you are able to fit at least 100 tracks due to its compressed file size (Webwise Team, 2012). Older formats can also be converted to .MP3 format to reduce its size. However, MP3 is substandard in regards to sound quality. Other formats such as .WAV played through a HI-FI system offers the listener a substantial increase in quality.<p>
	<p>We are able to choose the ones we like; we stream them or download them; transfer them into our portable device;create and recreate playlists (Denegri-Knott, 2015, p.397-401). However, this is prone to misuse. Piracy is a main concern when it comes to MP3s as users are capable of distributing and downloading tracks due to their convenient file size. Although they are downloaded quickly, they suffer a significant amount of quality loss due to its compression which provides a different experience. Generally it is argued whether the average listener can distinguish the differences between MP3 and a higher quality format. But experts claim the MP3 format is recommended to the “casual” listener (Denegri-Knott, 2015, p.397-401). Therefore the average user is not required to purchase any additional hardware, as the MP3 format listened through basic speakers or headphones is sufficient for a casual listener.<p>
	<p>Due to MP3’s widespread use it can be considered as the universal sound format. The majority of media players will support the MP3 format, which further encourages its use. However with its success, it induces hearing loss, MP3-induced hearing loss may be evolving into a significant social and public health problem in young people (Vogel, Brug, Van Der Ploeg, Catharina & Raat 2011, p.254-264). Although it is argued that listening to music for more than 1 hour at 89 dBA could cause hearing loss. This can easily be prevented by listening to music in moderation and adjusting the volume to an appropriate level.
